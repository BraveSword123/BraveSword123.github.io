## 💾 Annabelle_Moore.exe

**Annabelle_Moore.exe** is my official personal website — a nostalgic, interactive experience styled like a 2000s-era Windows desktop. It serves as a portfolio for all of my completed web development projects and includes my resume for anyone interested in learning more about my background or hiring me.

## 🖥️ About the Project

This website is designed to look and feel like the homescreen of a retro Windows XP laptop. Each "desktop icon" links to a unique web development project. Just like exploring a real desktop, users can click around to discover interactive apps and resources.
